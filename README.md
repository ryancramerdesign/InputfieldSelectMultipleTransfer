# Select Multiple Transfer

## Multi-selection Inputfield module for ProcessWire

<img src='https://raw.github.com/ryancramerdesign/InputfieldSelectMultipleTransfer/master/screenshot.png'>

Uses the [jquery.uix.multiselect](https://github.com/yanickrochon/jquery.uix.multiselect) plugin by Yanick Rochon.
Made into a ProcessWire module by Ryan Cramer. See also this [video demonstrating the module](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUILYtsQChw).

This Inputfield provides similar capabilities to asmSelect but may be more convenient when 
needing to select a large quantity of items. It also has a built-in search field for filtering.
It can be used anywhere that the other ProcessWire multi-selection inputfields can be used. 

## How to Install

This module is installed like any other, however you will need to take an extra step in order
to make it available for page selection. After installing this module, click to your Modules
menu and click the core InputfieldPage module to configure it (Modules > Core > Inputfields > Page).
Select *InputfieldSelectMultipleTransfer* as an allowed Inputfield for Page selection, and save.
